title: Introducing conformal field theory

---
[conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory) (中文又稱作保角場論)是一種近代在高能物理和數學各方面都有重要應用的理論，本文主要是想對這樣的理論做一個粗淺的介紹，更多lecture note 關於 conformal field theory 可以在 [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) 找到。若有任何錯誤或想討論可以告知。
> A conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. In two dimensions, there is an infinite-dimensional algebra of local conformal transformations, and conformal field theories can sometimes be exactly solved or classified. Conformal field theory has important applications[1] to condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and string theory. Statistical and condensed matter systems are indeed often conformally invariant at their thermodynamic or quantum critical points.
